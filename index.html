    Muller and Dweck both speak on their views on how learning works, by speaking on the common idea of the lack of knowlege. Dweck mostly focuses on her two points of emphasis of learning, growth learning and fixed learning. Someone with a fixed mindset would believe that all knowlegdge comes naturally while the latter, belives that one must work hard in order to gain the knowledge they seek. Miller also indirectly speaks on how in order for a pereson to learn they must walk through questions they don't quite know the answer to until they do. The main point of their views is that the best way for someone to learn is to not be afraid of failure and acknowledge that they do not completely undstand everything but are capabel of doing so with applied help and dedication. It is hard for anyone to learn by being given the answer all the time which is why the "test and fail" method is one of the most impactful ways to learn. From Dweck's research of learning methods and Muller's continuation of asking difficutl but not hard questions, they show the difference between how people learn from a growth mindset and fixed.
